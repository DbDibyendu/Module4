# Problem 1

Hi guys, since this is the last module and I want you guys to have a taste of 
what actually happens in the Internship, the problems will be given in the 
Internship format.

Mostly the Internship will contain tasks given in the format below.

### Goal : Implement a full-duplex communication using a MQTT protocol. 

### Description
You guys have to implement 
- MQTT broker 
- MQTT client 

- You can use either C or CPP for the MQTT Client. 
- You can use these MQTT Client libraries to make your MQTT client.
    - C library - https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c
    - CPP library - https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.cpp 

- You can use either C or CPP or Python or JS for coding the MQTT Broker. 
- You **must** to [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) broker for the MQTT. 
- For this you may have to install Rabbit MQ server on your laptop and enable the MQTT plug-in.
    - Installation of Rabbit MQ (docker install recommended) - https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html 
    - Rabbit MQ documentation - https://www.rabbitmq.com/admin-guide.html

### Acceptance Criteria 
This is the criteria to accept the assignment.
- **Must** have documentation for setting up MQTT broker and MQTT Client.
- **Must** follow the Coding Standards.
- Broker **MUST** be Rabbit MQ.
- You must show the proof of the communication working, here I am allowing you to use your own creativity to show proof, it can be images, videos, etc... 
- All your Codes for Broker or client should be added into a folder named `MQTT` 

**Note**: This might seem a little hard for an assignment but Internship Tasks are of higher difficulty than this, So in preparation for the internship this is your real test. Please don't give up easily, figure out ways to reach the goal with the acceptance criteria.
