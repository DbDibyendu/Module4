# Problem 2

Hi guys, since this is the last module and I want you guys to have a taste of 
what actually happens in the Internship, the problems will be given in the 
Internship format.

Mostly the Internship will contain tasks given in the format below.

### Goal : Implement a full-duplex communication using a LWM2M protocol. 

### Description
You guys have to implement  
- LWM2M client 

- You can use either C or CPP for the LWM2M Client. 
- You can use these LWM2M Client libraries to make your LWM2M client.
    - C library - https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay
    - C library - https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama

- You can use either implement your own LWM2M server or use a public server, for testing purposes.
    - Link to the public server - https://leshan.eclipseprojects.io/
    - Link to implementing your own server - https://github.com/eclipse/leshan

### Acceptance Criteria 
This is the criteria to accept the assignment.
- **Must** have documentation for setting up LWM2M Client.
- **Must** follow the Coding Standards.
- You must show the proof of the communication working, here I am allowing you to use your own creativity to show proof, it can be images, videos, etc... 

**Note**: This might seem a little hard for an assignment but Internship Tasks are of higher difficulty than this, So in preparation for the internship this is your real test. Please don't give up easily, figure out ways to reach the goal with the acceptance criteria.
